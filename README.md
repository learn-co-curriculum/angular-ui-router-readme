# What is ui-router?

## Overview

`ngRoute` provides us with basic functionality, but the leading router for Angular is `uiRouter`. This provides much more, such as nested views, multiple views and a few different offerings. Let's take a look at how `uiRouter` does things instead.

## Objectives

- Describe ui-router and ui-view
- Write a route using ui-router
- Integrate a Controller with ui-router
- Integrate a template with ui-router

## uiRouter

`uiRouter` is quite similar to `ngRoute`, but each "route" is known as a "state". We define states, not routes.

Each state that we define is quite similar to a route in `ngRoute`, but we have to give each state a name too. This allows us to have children states inside of a state (we'll go onto nested states/views soon).

This is awesome - you might've noticed how in the last lab we've got three links to `#/user/name`. Instead, with uiRouter, we can use the state names instead of URLs. This saves us time in the long run - if we have 100 different places in our app that link to the user page, imagine having to update all of them to the URL if it ever changed! However, as we've got state names, we won't have to update any of them.

Let's take a look at how we'd define a route in `ngRoute`:

```js
angular
	.module('app', ['ngRoute'])
	.config(function ($routeProvider) {
		$routeProvider
			.when('/user', {
				templateUrl: 'views/user.html',
				controller: 'UserController'
			});
	});
```

And how we'd define a route in `uiRouter`:

```js
angular
	.module('app', ['ui.router'])
	.config(function ($stateProvider) {
		$stateProvider
			.state('user', {
				url: '/user',
				templateUrl: 'views/user.html',
				controller: 'UserController'
			});
	});
```

You can see they're very similar. We've moved the URL into the configuration object, and replaced the URL with the state's name. We're also using `$stateProvider` instead of `$routeProvider`.

Instead of using `ng-view`, we use `ui-view` to place the states in our HTML.

We'll go into more advanced concepts with `uiRouter` soon - things such as nested views and resolving data.

## uiSref

`uiRouter` also provides a directive named `ui-sref` (as in, [$state.href()](http://angular-ui.github.io/ui-router/site/#/api/ui.router.state.directive:ui-sref)). We mentioned earlier about linking to states by name - this is where `uiSref` comes in. We can use this on our hyperlinks to generate links to our states. We pass in the state name as the value and `uiRouter` will replace the link with a link to our state.

Say we've got a state named `docs`, that links to `/documentation/v1`:

```js
angular
	.module('app', ['ui.router'])
	.config(function ($stateProvider) {
		$stateProvider
			.state('docs', {
				url: '/documentation/v1',
				templateUrl: 'views/documentation.html',
				controller: 'DocsController'
			});
	});
```

We can then use `ui-sref="docs"` to link to that state.

```html
<a href="" ui-sref="docs">Go to the docs!</a>
```

This will then get automatically changed into:

```html
<a href="/documentation/v1">Go to the docs!</a>
```

This is awesome - we can change the URL on our states without changing the name and all of our links get updated to match the new URL.

## uiSrefActive

`uiRouter` also provides us with one more directive - `ui-sref-active`. We pass in a class name as the value, and when the given state inside our `ui-sref` is active, it will apply this class to the link.

For instance, if we have this:

```html
<a href="" ui-sref="docs" ui-sref-active="active">Go to the docs!</a>
```

When we're actually on the docs page, that link will get the `active` class applied to it:

```html
<a href="" class="active" ui-sref="docs" ui-sref-active="active">Go to the docs!</a>
```

Simple!
